    "description": "With the same immediacy as in the previous drill, press the fingers down and empty them, one at a time, in order. This time, however, do not keep your fingers touching the string when not playing. When you empty a finger that has finished playing, spring it back into its place; about half an inch above the string. Since we will be dealing with the right hand in the later section, don't worry about which right-hand fingering to use for now. A simple *i, m* alternation will do. Use rest stroke or free stroke - it doesn't matter. Just focus on your left hand.",
